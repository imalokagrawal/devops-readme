## What is DevOps Project

Azure DevOps Project helps you launch an app on an Azure App Service of your choice in a few quick steps and set you up with everything you need for developing, deploying, and monitoring your app. Creating a DevOps Project provisions Azure resources and comes with a Git code repository, Application Insights integration and a continuous delivery pipeline setup to deploy to Azure. The DevOps Project dashboard lets you monitor code commits, builds and, deployments, from a single view in the Azure portal.

Key benefits of a DevOps Project:
* Get up and running with a new app and a full DevOps pipeline in just a few minutes
* Support for a wide range of popular frameworks such as .NET, Java, PHP, Node, and Python
* Start fresh or bring your own application from GitHub
* Built-in Application Insights integration for instant analytics and actionable insights
* Cloud-powered CI/CD using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)

## How To Use
Getting started is super simple here. Just a few clicks and your CI/CD pipeline is ready for you in minutes.
Go to [New DevOps Project page on Azure Portal ](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureProject)
* Step 1 - Select the language you are want to target like .NET, PHP, Python, Java, Node, Go or Ruby
* Step 2 - Select your favourite framework for the selected language. DevOps project supports a variety of frameworks today
* Step 3 - Select where you want to deploy your new application. For example, you can select Azure WebApp, Virtual Machines, Containers, Service Fabric etc.
